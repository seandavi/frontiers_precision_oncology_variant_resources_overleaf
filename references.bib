              is one of the major challenges for personalized health and

              network based classifier that improves over the state-of-the-art
              in distinguishing between effect and neutral variants. Our
              method's improved performance results from screening many
              potentially relevant protein features and from refining our
              development data sets. Cross-validated on >100k experimentally
              annotated variants, SNAP2 significantly outperformed other
              methods, attaining a two-state accuracy (effect/neutral) of 83\%.
              SNAP2 also outperformed combinations of other methods.
              Performance increased for human variants but much more so for
              other organisms. Our method's carefully calibrated reliability
              index informs selection of variants for experimental follow up,
              with the most strongly predicted half of all effect variants
              predicted at over 96\% accuracy. As expected, the evolutionary
              information from automatically generated multiple sequence
              alignments gave the strongest signal for the prediction. However,
              we also optimized our new method to perform surprisingly well
              even without alignments. This feature reduces prediction runtime
              by over two orders of magnitude, enables cross-genome

              the 10-20\% of sequence orphans. SNAP2 is available at:

                 rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)
                 have been associated with marked clinical responses to
                 crizotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting ALK.
                 Whether crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy with
                 respect to efficacy is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a phase
                 3, open-label trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in
                 347 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive
                 lung cancer who had received one prior platinum-based regimen.
                 Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with
                 crizotinib (250 mg) twice daily or intravenous chemotherapy
                 with either pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of
                 body-surface area) or docetaxel (75 mg per square meter) every
                 3 weeks. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease
                 progression were permitted to cross over to crizotinib as part
                 of a separate study. The primary end point was
                 progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median
                 progression-free survival was 7.7 months in the crizotinib
                 group and 3.0 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio
                 for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95\%
                 confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). The response
                 rates were 65\% (95\% CI, 58 to 72) with crizotinib, as
                 compared with 20\% (95\% CI, 14 to 26) with chemotherapy
                 (P<0.001). An interim analysis of overall survival showed no
                 significant improvement with crizotinib as compared with
                 chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death in the crizotinib group,
                 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 1.54; P=0.54). Common adverse events
                 associated with crizotinib were visual disorder,
                 gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver
                 aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with
                 chemotherapy were fatigue, alopecia, and dyspnea. Patients
                 reported greater reductions in symptoms of lung cancer and
                 greater improvement in global quality of life with crizotinib
                 than with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib is superior to
                 standard chemotherapy in patients with previously treated,
                 advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement.

              treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) that unleashes
              pre-existing immune responses against recognized tumor antigens.
              Somatic mutations lead to the formation of neoantigens, which are
              highly antigenic mutant proteins. Methods: Our objective was to
              generate a neoantigen map through analysis of whole exome
              sequencing data of our cohort of patients (pts) with
              platinum-resistant UC. Whole exome sequencing (WES) data from 73
              prospectively collected UC samples from 34 patients were analyzed
              using our neoantigen prediction pipeline. We defined neoantigens
              as mutant nonamers with high affinity binding to predicted class
              I MHC molecules for each patient. HLA haplotypes were inferred
              from WES of matched germline DNA. Results: A significant
              correlation between global somatic mutation rates, and
              neo-epitope burden was observed (R2 = 0.93), a similar
              correlation was observed between single nucleotide variants (SNV)
              and neo-epitope burdens (R2 = 0.94). We identified a strong
              positive correlation between the numbers of pack-years of smoking
              and neoepitope burden in patients with advanced UC (p = 0.0004).
              No correlation between global somatic mutational and predicted
              neoepitope burdens with overall survival was identified.
              Metastatic samples had a trend of harboring more SNVs (median 49
              vs. 22, P = 0.13), and neoepitopes (median 17 vs 12, P = 0.22)
              compared to primary samples. Interestingly, only 32\% of total
              SNVs and 8 \% of neoepitopes (with binding affinities of [$\leq$]
              50nM) that were initially identified, reappeared in metastatic
              samples from the same patients obtained at a later time point. A
              significant selection against strong binding neo-epitopes was
              observed in subsequent samples from metastatic tumors (p-value <
              0.005). Conclusions: A strong correlation between mutational
              burden and predicted neoantigenic load was observed in UC.
              Neoantigenic signatures were shaped by environmental exposures
              such as smoking. The significant heterogeneity in primary and
              metastatic neoantigens was possibly due to immunoediting as the
              tumor evolved. These findings may have important implications for
              selecting patients for immunotherapeutic approaches.",

  abstract    = "PURPOSE: We conducted a basket clinical trial to assess the
                 feasibility of such a design strategy and to independently
                 evaluate the effects of multiple targeted agents against
                 specific molecular aberrations in multiple histologic subtypes
                 concurrently. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with
                 advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung
                 cancer, and thymic malignancies who underwent genomic
                 characterization of oncogenic drivers. Patients were enrolled
                 onto a not-otherwise-specified arm and treated with
                 standard-of-care therapies or one of the following five
                 biomarker-matched treatment groups: erlotinib for EGFR
                 mutations; selumetinib for KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, or BRAF
                 mutations; MK2206 for PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN mutations;
                 lapatinib for ERBB2 mutations or amplifications; and sunitinib
                 for KIT or PDGFRA mutations or amplification. RESULTS: Six
                 hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled, and 88\% had their
                 tumors tested for at least one gene. EGFR mutation frequency
                 was 22.1\% in NSCLC, and erlotinib achieved a response rate of
                 60\% (95\% CI, 32.3\% to 83.7\%). KRAS mutation frequency was
                 24.9\% in NSCLC, and selumetinib failed to achieve its primary
                 end point, with a response rate of 11\% (95\% CI, 0\% to
                 48\%). Completion of accrual to all other arms was not
                 feasible. In NSCLC, patients with EGFR mutations had the
                 longest median survival (3.51 years; 95\% CI, 2.89 to 5.5
                 years), followed by those with ALK rearrangements (2.94 years;
                 95\% CI, 1.66 to 4.61 years), those with KRAS mutations (2.3
                 years; 95\% CI, 2.3 to 2.17 years), those with other genetic
                 abnormalities (2.17 years; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.74 years), and
                 those without an actionable mutation (1.85 years; 95\% CI,
                 1.61 to 2.13 years). CONCLUSION: This basket trial design was
                 not feasible for many of the arms with rare mutations, but it
                 allowed the study of the genetics of less common malignancies.",

                 major challenge in interpreting whole-exome data is predicting
                 which of the discovered variants are deleterious or neutral.
                 To address this question in silico, we have developed a score
                 called Combined Annotation scoRing toOL (CAROL), which
                 combines information from 2 bioinformatics tools: PolyPhen-2
                 and SIFT, in order to improve the prediction of the effect of
                 non-synonymous coding variants. METHODS: We used a weighted Z
                 method that combines the probabilistic scores of PolyPhen-2
                 and SIFT. We defined 2 dataset pairs to train and test CAROL
                 using information from the dbSNP: 'HGMD-PUBLIC' and 1000

                 coming years will continue to drive--the emergence of long
                 catalogs of missense single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the
                 human genome. As a consequence, researchers have developed
                 various methods and their related computational tools to
                 classify these missense SNVs as probably deleterious or
                 probably neutral polymorphisms. The outputs produced by each
                 of these computational tools are of different natures and thus
                 difficult to compare and integrate. Taking advantage of the
                 possible complementarity between different tools might allow
                 more accurate classifications. Here we propose an effective
                 approach to integrating the output of some of these tools into
                 a unified classification; this approach is based on a weighted
                 average of the normalized scores of the individual methods
                 (WAS). (In this paper, the approach is illustrated for the
                 integration of five tools.) We show that this WAS outperforms
                 each individual method in the task of classifying missense
                 SNVs as deleterious or neutral. Furthermore, we demonstrate
                 that this WAS can be used not only for classification purposes
                 (deleterious versus neutral mutation) but also as an indicator
                 of the impact of the mutation on the functionality of the
                 mutant protein. In other words, it may be used as a
                 deleteriousness score of missense SNVs. Therefore, we
                 recommend the use of this WAS as a consensus deleteriousness
                 score of missense mutations (Condel).",

              to integrate information across platforms provided key insights

              the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining
              data from five platforms, each of which shows significant
              molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes
              (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10\% incidence across all
              breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated
              and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific
              mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype.
              We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups,

                 previously untreatable cancers. Until recently, vaccines and
                 adoptive cell therapies have been designed to target public
                 tumor antigens common to multiple patients rather than private
                 antigens specific to a single patient. Due to the difficulty
                 of identifying public antigens that are expressed exclusively
                 on tumor cells, these studies have yielded both clinical
                 successes and serious immune-related adverse events. Multiple
                 avenues of research now underscore the centrality of
                 tumor-specific mutated private antigens to endogenous
                 anti-tumor immunity. Immunotherapies that target these
                 neoantigens may enable safer and more durable tumor
                 regression, but personalized targeting presents a number of
                 challenges. Foremost among these is to develop processes that
                 accelerate advancement from neoantigen discovery to use of
                 these neoantigens as vaccines or as targets for adoptive cell
                 therapies. Exome sequencing has facilitated discovery of
                 neoantigens for melanoma and other highly mutated cancers. New
                 technologies - possibly proceeding from T cell receptor
                 repertoire sequencing - are needed to identify antigens for
                 cancers with low mutational burden and few neoantigens. In
                 this review, we discuss progress toward personalizing T
                 cell-mediated immunotherapy for cancer as well as challenges
                 going forward.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Personalized therapy provides the best outcome of
                 cancer care and its implementation in the clinic has been
                 greatly facilitated by recent convergence of enormous progress
                 in basic cancer research, rapid advancement of new tumor
                 profiling technologies, and an expanding compendium of
                 targeted cancer therapeutics. METHODS: We developed a
                 personalized cancer therapy (PCT) program in a clinical
                 setting, using an integrative genomics approach to fully
                 characterize the complexity of each tumor. We carried out
                 whole exome sequencing (WES) and single-nucleotide
                 polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping on DNA from tumor and
                 patient-matched normal specimens, as well as RNA sequencing
                 (RNA-Seq) on available frozen specimens, to identify somatic
                 (tumor-specific) mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs),
                 gene expression changes, gene fusions, and also germline
                 variants. To provide high sensitivity in known cancer mutation
                 hotspots, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2) was
                 also employed. We integrated the resulting data with cancer
                 knowledge bases and developed a specific workflow for each
                 cancer type to improve interpretation of genomic data.
                 RESULTS: We returned genomics findings to 46 patients and
                 their physicians describing somatic alterations and predicting
                 drug response, toxicity, and prognosis. Mean 17.3
                 cancer-relevant somatic mutations per patient were identified,
                 13.3-fold, 6.9-fold, and 4.7-fold more than could have been
                 detected using CHPv2, Oncomine Cancer Panel (OCP), and
                 FoundationOne, respectively. Our approach delineated the
                 underlying genetic drivers at the pathway level and provided
                 meaningful predictions of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity.
                 Actionable alterations were found in 91 \% of patients (mean
                 4.9 per patient, including somatic mutations, copy number
                 alterations, gene expression alterations, and germline
                 variants), a 7.5-fold, 2.0-fold, and 1.9-fold increase over
                 what could have been uncovered by CHPv2, OCP, and
                 FoundationOne, respectively. The findings altered the course
                 of treatment in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
                 that a comprehensive, integrative genomic approach as outlined
                 above significantly enhanced genomics-based PCT strategies.",

                 drivers from passengers is challenging because drivers occur
                 much less frequently than passengers, they tend to have low
                 prevalence, their functions are multifactorial and not
                 intuitively obvious. Missense mutations are excellent
                 candidates as drivers, as they occur more frequently and are
                 potentially easier to identify than other types of mutations.
                 Although several methods have been developed for predicting
                 the functional impact of missense mutations, only a few have
                 been specifically designed for identifying driver mutations.
                 As more mutations are being discovered, more accurate
                 predictive models can be developed using machine learning

                 elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple
                 alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat,
                 chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been
                 performed with multiple alignments of four insect species
                 (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two
                 species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces.
                 Conserved elements were identified with a computer program
                 called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic
                 hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a
                 phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to
                 constraints designed to calibrate the model across species
                 groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this
                 model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the
                 human genome (depending on the details of the calibration
                 procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more
                 compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis

                 genome size and general biological complexity, increasing
                 fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the
                 exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most
                 highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are
                 hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share
                 certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend
                 to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap
                 genes of somewhat different functional categories. In
                 vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of
                 regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized
                 regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences.

                 is associated with reactivation of the mitogen-activated
                 protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To address this problem, we
                 conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with
                 dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a
                 selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor. METHODS: In this
                 open-label study involving 247 patients with metastatic
                 melanoma and BRAF V600 mutations, we evaluated the
                 pharmacokinetic activity and safety of oral dabrafenib (75 or
                 150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (1, 1.5, or 2 mg daily) in
                 85 patients and then randomly assigned 162 patients to receive
                 combination therapy with dabrafenib (150 mg) plus trametinib
                 (1 or 2 mg) or dabrafenib monotherapy. The primary end points
                 were the incidence of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma,
                 survival free of melanoma progression, and response. Secondary
                 end points were overall survival and pharmacokinetic activity.
                 RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects were infrequently
                 observed in patients receiving combination therapy with 150 mg
                 of dabrafenib and 2 mg of trametinib (combination 150/2).
                 Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was seen in 7\% of patients
                 receiving combination 150/2 and in 19\% receiving monotherapy
                 (P=0.09), whereas pyrexia was more common in the combination
                 150/2 group than in the monotherapy group (71\% vs. 26\%).
                 Median progression-free survival in the combination 150/2
                 group was 9.4 months, as compared with 5.8 months in the
                 monotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death,
                 0.39; 95\% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.62; P<0.001). The
                 rate of complete or partial response with combination 150/2
                 therapy was 76\%, as compared with 54\% with monotherapy
                 (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib and trametinib were safely
                 combined at full monotherapy doses. The rate of pyrexia was
                 increased with combination therapy, whereas the rate of
                 proliferative skin lesions was nonsignificantly reduced.
                 Progression-free survival was significantly improved. (Funded

              processing them with bioinformatics tools and pipelines.
              Alternatively, researchers can upload data to online tools, which
              may conflict with privacy requirements. We present here Kaviar, a
              tool that greatly simplifies the assessment of novel variants.

              preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of
              human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological
              annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line
              Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression,
              chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data
              from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with
              pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of
              the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of
              genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug
              sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that
              plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor
              inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor
              efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted
              sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results
              indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to
              enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents.
              The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the
              preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical
              trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized'
              therapeutic regimens.",

                 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis

                 types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an emerging
                 biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors and
                 has been shown to be more significantly associated with
                 response to PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy than PD-1 or
                 PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
                 The distribution of TMB and the subset of patients with high
                 TMB has not been well characterized in the majority of cancer
                 types. METHODS: In this study, we compare TMB measured by a
                 targeted comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to TMB
                 measured by exome sequencing and simulate the expected
                 variance in TMB when sequencing less than the whole exome. We
                 then describe the distribution of TMB across a diverse cohort
                 of 100,000 cancer cases and test for association between
                 somatic alterations and TMB in over 100 tumor types. RESULTS:
                 We demonstrate that measurements of TMB from comprehensive
                 genomic profiling are strongly reflective of measurements from
                 whole exome sequencing and model that below 0.5 Mb the
                 variance in measurement increases significantly. We find that
                 a subset of patients exhibits high TMB across almost all types
                 of cancer, including many rare tumor types, and characterize
                 the relationship between high TMB and microsatellite
                 instability status. We find that TMB increases significantly
                 with age, showing a 2.4-fold difference between age 10 and age
                 90 years. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of TMB
                 and identify genes and mutations associated with TMB level. We
                 identify a cluster of somatic mutations in the promoter of the
                 gene PMS2, which occur in 10\% of skin cancers and are highly
                 associated with increased TMB. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
                 that a CGP assay targeting ~1.1 Mb of coding genome can
                 accurately assess TMB compared with sequencing the whole
                 exome. Using this method, we find that many disease types have
                 a substantial portion of patients with high TMB who might
                 benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we identify novel,
                 recurrent promoter mutations in PMS2, which may be another
                 example of regulatory mutations contributing to tumorigenesis.",

                 because of the presence of driver and passenger mutations, it
                 is often challenging to assign the clinical relevance of

              techniques presents many novel opportunities for many
              applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads
              produced by these techniques, however, pose significant
              computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic
              analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and
              several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software
              packages to perform this function. As the developers of these
              packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various
              considerations, the relative merits of different software
              packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and
              use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important
              consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for
              their application. RESULTS: With a view to comparing existing
              short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and
              evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different
              configurations of various factors, including sequencing error,
              indels, and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the
              performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g.,
              some packages return a single alignment while some return
              multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we
              comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and
              mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy
              and runtime. Conclusion: We expect that the results presented
              here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment
              software that is most suitable for their specific research aims.
              Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be
              considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can also be
              used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep
              sequencing data for various purposes (e.g., identification of

                 recurrence, multiplicity and annotation for ∼10 000 mutations
                 in the COSMIC database, the method does well in assigning
                 higher scores to more likely functional mutations ('drivers').
                 To guide experimental prioritization, we report a list of
                 about 1000 top human cancer genes frequently mutated in one or
                 more cancer types ranked by likely functional impact; and, an
                 additional 1000 candidate cancer genes with rare but likely
                 functional mutations. In addition, we estimate that at least
                 5\% of cancer-relevant mutations involve switch of function,

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the
              new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast
              and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash
              table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
              accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from
              a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped
              alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for
              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with
              Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
              sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
              human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
              base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x
              faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
              BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence
              Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream
              analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source

  abstract = "New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA
              sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short
              reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these
              reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
              particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short
              reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of
              accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of
              mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually
              comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping
              algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies
              by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using
              quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence
              of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full
              use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability
              of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for
              the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that
              incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the
              raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and
              an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read
              mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and
              real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The ability to analyze the genomics of
                 malignancies has opened up new possibilities for off-label
                 targeted therapy in cancers that are refractory to standard
                 therapy. At Mayo Clinic these efforts are organized through
                 the Center for Individualized Medicine (CIM). RESULTS: Prior
                 to GTB, datasets were analyzed and integrated by a team of
                 bioinformaticians and cancer biologists. Therapeutically
                 actionable mutations were identified in 65\% (92/141) of the
                 patients tested with 32\% (29/92) receiving genomically
                 targeted therapy with FDA approved drugs or in an independent
                 clinical trial with 45\% (13/29) responding. Standard of care
                 (SOC) options were continued by 15\% (14/92) of patients
                 tested before exhausting SOC options, with 71\% (10/14)
                 responding to treatment. Over 35\% (34/92) of patients with
                 actionable targets were not treated with 65\% (22/34) choosing
                 comfort measures or passing away. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
                 Patients (N = 165) were referred to the CIM Clinic between
                 October 2012 and December 2015. All patients received clinical
                 genomic panel testing with selected subsets receiving array
                 comparative genomic hybridization and clinical whole exome
                 sequencing to complement and validate panel findings. A
                 genomic tumor board (GTB) reviewed results and, when possible,
                 developed treatment recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment
                 decisions driven by tumor genomic analysis can lead to
                 significant clinical benefit in a minority of patients. The
                 success of genomically driven therapy depends both on access
                 to drugs and robustness of bioinformatics analysis. While
                 novel clinical trial designs are increasing the utility of
                 genomic testing, robust data sharing of outcomes is needed to
                 optimize clinical benefit for all patients.",

              primary prostate carcinomas. Our results revealed a molecular
              taxonomy in which 74\% of these tumors fell into one of seven
              subtypes defined by specific gene fusions (ERG, ETV1/4, and FLI1)

              substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a
              methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied
              widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1
              mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced
              transcripts. 25\% of the prostate cancers had a presumed
              actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA

                 faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely
                 used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic
                 sequences. However, most existing methods consider either
                 reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate
                 but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across
                 the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general
                 problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of
                 substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific
                 manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for
                 addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score
                 test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of
                 substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling
                 (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely
                 available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation
                 experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical
                 power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be
                 capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive
                 rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides,
                 moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or
                 clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying
                 phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE
                 project, we shed light on patterns of
                 conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional
                 elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to
                 constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the

               Philadelphia, PA Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies
               provide unprecedented capacity to comprehensively identify the
               alterations, genes, and pathways involved in the tumorigenic
               process, raising the hope of extending targeted therapies
               against the drivers of cancer from a few successful examples to
               a broader personalized medicine strategy. However, high
               intertumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle to develop and
               apply therapeutic targeted agents to treat most cancer patient.
               In addition, advances in our ability to precisely assign the
               most effective targeted therapy to each patient based on the
               genome events driving the tumor are urgently needed. The present
               study offers the first comprehensive assessment of the scope of
               targeted drugs in a large pan-cancer cohort. To pursue this
               goal, we developed a three-step in silico drug prescription
               strategy. We first identified the driver genes acting across
               6792 tumor samples from 28 different cancer types via an
               integrated analysis of their mutations, copy number alterations
               and gene fusions. All information pertaining these driver genes
               has been compiled in a publicly available Drivers Database.
               Next, following the rationale that targeted therapies are
               effective only if they are administered to treat tumors driven
               by the alterations they are aimed at, we collected all
               therapeutic agents capable of targeting altered driver genes
               either directly, indirectly or through gene therapies. The
               catalog of available therapeutic agents and ancillary
               information on their application, referred here as Drivers
               Actionability Database, included FDA (Foods and Drugs
               Administration Agency) approved drugs, agents undergoing
               clinical trials, and ligands in pre-clinical stages. Finally,
               based on the driver alterations in each tumor in the cohort and
               the rules in the Drivers Actionability Database, we connected
               each patient to all targeted therapies that could benefit them,
               thus producing the landscape of utility of targeted therapeutic
               agents in the cohort. We found that only a minority of patients
               could benefit from approved targeted therapy interventions
               following clinical guidelines (5.9\%), while up to 40\% could
               benefit from different types of repurposing opportunities of
               approve drugs, and up to 78\% considering treatments currently
               under investigation. In addition, we identified 16
               therapeutically unexploited cancer genes targeted by small
               molecules currently in pre-clinical stages, and 66 others
               structurally suitable for small molecule binding or accessible
               by antibody targeting. These results highlight the current scope
               of targeted anti-cancer therapies and its prospects for growth.
               The application of the strategy to larger cohorts and the
               continuous update of drug-target interactions information, will
               improve the in silico prescription rules contained within the
               two databases, thus enhancing its usefulness within personalized

              Leveraging existing standards such as Human Genome Variation
              Society (HGVS) variant description format, we implemented a data

              A REpresentational State Transfer (REST) application-programming
              interface (API) was implemented to query the PMKB
              programmatically. At the time of writing, PMKB contains 457

                 sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries
                 generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC).
                 This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average
                 of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides
                 direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational
                 recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective
                 metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to
                 identify genes subject to strong selection against various
                 classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with
                 near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating

                 established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate
                 that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of
                 candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The increasing practicality of genomic sequencing
                 technology has led to its incorporation into routine clinical
                 practice. Successful identification and targeting of driver
                 genomic alterations that provide proliferative and survival
                 advantages to tumor cells have led to approval and ongoing
                 development of several targeted cancer therapies. Within many
                 major cancer centers, molecular tumor boards are constituted
                 to shepherd precision medicine into clinical practice.
                 MATERIALS AND METHODS: In July 2014, the Clinical Genomics
                 Action Committee (CGAC) was established as the molecular tumor
                 board companion to the Personalized Medicine Clinical Service
                 (PMCS) at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. The
                 processes and outcomes of the program were assessed in order
                 to help others move into the practice of precision medicine.
                 RESULTS: Through the establishment and initial 1,400 patients
                 of the PMCS and its associated molecular tumor board at a
                 major cancer center, five practical lessons of broad
                 applicability have been learned: transdisciplinary engagement,
                 the use of the molecular report as an aid to clinical
                 management, clinical actionability, getting therapeutic
                 options to patients, and financial considerations. Value to
                 patients includes access to cutting-edge practice merged with
                 individualized preferences in treatment and care. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Genomic-driven cancer medicine is increasingly becoming a part
                 of routine clinical practice. For successful implementation of
                 precision cancer medicine, strategically organized molecular
                 tumor boards are critical to provide objective evidence-based
                 translation of observed molecular alterations into
                 patient-centered clinical action. Molecular tumor board
                 implementation models along with clinical and economic
                 outcomes will define future treatment standards. The
                 Oncologist 2017;22:144-151Implications for Practice: It is
                 clear that the increasing practicality of genetic tumor
                 sequencing technology has led to its incorporation as part of
                 routine clinical practice. Subsequently, many cancer centers
                 are seeking to develop a personalized medicine services and/or
                 molecular tumor board to shepherd precision medicine into
                 clinical practice. This article discusses the key lessons
                 learned through the establishment and development of a
                 molecular tumor board and personalized medicine clinical
                 service. This article highlights practical issues and can
                 serve as an important guide to other centers as they conceive
                 and develop their own personalized medicine services and
                 molecular tumor boards.",

                 provides an intuitive graphical user interface and a
                 documented application programming interface (API) for
                 querying these data. DGIdb was assembled through an extensive
                 manual curation effort, reflecting the combined information of
                 twenty-seven sources. For DGIdb 2.0, substantial updates have
                 been made to increase content and improve its usefulness as a
                 resource for mining clinically actionable drug targets.
                 Specifically, nine new sources of drug-gene interactions have
                 been added, including seven resources specifically focused on
                 interactions linked to clinical trials. These additions have
                 more than doubled the overall count of drug-gene interactions.
                 The total number of druggable gene claims has also increased
                 by 30\%. Importantly, a majority of the unrestricted,
                 publicly-accessible sources used in DGIdb are now
                 automatically updated on a weekly basis, providing the most
                 current information for these sources. Finally, a new web view
                 and API have been developed to allow searching for
                 interactions by drug identifiers to complement existing
                 gene-based search functionality. With these updates, DGIdb

                 characterize the function of proteins on a large scale. We
                 describe a method, PANTHER, for relating protein sequence
                 relationships to function relationships in a robust and
                 accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the
                 PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index
                 (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB is a collection of ``books,'' each
                 representing a protein family as a multiple sequence
                 alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree.
                 Functional divergence within the family is represented by
                 dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and
                 by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for
                 summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological
                 processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We
                 apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we
                 report the size and sequence diversity of the families and
                 subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence
                 divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of
                 protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to
                 give a high-level representation of gene function across the
                 human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank
                 missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a
                 database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of

                 remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally
                 important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed
                 the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
                 and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional
                 consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting

                 regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes
                 Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases
                 from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set
                 conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also
                 illustrate a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs

                 stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to
                 be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the

                 variants is essential to report and exchange information on
                 the analysis of a genome. In particular, DNA diagnostics
                 critically depends on accurate and standardized description
                 and sharing of the variants detected. The sequence variant
                 nomenclature system proposed in 2000 by the Human Genome
                 Variation Society has been widely adopted and has developed
                 into an internationally accepted standard. The recommendations
                 are currently commissioned through a Sequence Variant
                 Description Working Group (SVD-WG) operating under the
                 auspices of three international organizations: the Human
                 Genome Variation Society (HGVS), the Human Variome Project
                 (HVP), and the Human Genome Organization (HUGO). Requests for
                 modifications and extensions go through the SVD-WG following a
                 standard procedure including a community consultation step.
                 Version numbers are assigned to the nomenclature system to
                 allow users to specify the version used in their variant
                 descriptions. Here, we present the current recommendations,
                 HGVS version 15.11, and briefly summarize the changes that
                 were made since the 2000 publication. Most focus has been on
                 removing inconsistencies and tightening definitions allowing
                 automatic data processing. An extensive version of the
                 recommendations is available online, at

                 genomes leverage comparative sequence information by looking
                 for regions that exhibit evidence of selective constraint. One
                 way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up
                 approach by computing constraint scores for individual
                 positions of a multiple alignment and then defining
                 constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring
                 nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that
                 uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for
                 position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous
                 bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to
                 subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a
                 richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them
                 based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for
                 biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we
                 identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over
                 7\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than
                 earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer
                 constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence
                 between predicted elements with known functional sequences.
                 GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both
                 nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep
                 multiple sequence alignments.",

  abstract  = "PurposeWith prospective clinical sequencing of tumors emerging
               as a mainstay in cancer care, an urgent need exists for a
               clinical support tool that distills the clinical implications
               associated with specific mutation events into a standardized and
               easily interpretable format. To this end, we developed OncoKB,
               an expert-guided precision oncology knowledge base.MethodsOncoKB
               annotates the biologic and oncogenic effects and prognostic and
               predictive significance of somatic molecular alterations.
               Potential treatment implications are stratified by the level of
               evidence that a specific molecular alteration is predictive of
               drug response on the basis of US Food and Drug Administration
               labeling, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines,
               disease-focused expert group recommendations, and scientific
               literature.ResultsTo date, > 3,000 unique mutations, fusions,
               and copy number alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes have
               been annotated. To test the utility of OncoKB, we annotated all
               genomic events in 5,983 primary tumor samples in 19 cancer
               types. Forty-one percent of samples harbored at least one
               potentially actionable alteration, of which 7.5\% were
               predictive of clinical benefit from a standard treatment. OncoKB
               annotations are available through a public Web resource
               (http://oncokb.org) and are incorporated into the cBioPortal for
               Cancer Genomics to facilitate the interpretation of genomic
               alterations by physicians and researchers.ConclusionOncoKB, a

                 Standard treatment of CML with TKIs is highly effective in
                 reducing disease burden, delaying disease progression, and
                 prolonging overall survival of patients; however, resistance
                 to TKI treatment has become an increasingly important cause of
                 treatment failure. The emergence of mutations in the BCR-ABL1
                 kinase domain is a common mechanism of TKI resistance, and
                 laboratory testing to detect these mutations is currently
                 available for clinical use. Patients who do not respond or
                 have lost their response to TKI therapy should be considered
                 for mutational testing. Despite clinical practice guidelines
                 that recommend testing for BCR-ABL1 mutations in patients with
                 clinical signs of TKI resistance, many oncologists and

                 should be done, and how testing results should be applied to
                 subsequent therapeutic decisions. It describes how BCR-ABL1

  abstract    = "As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive
                 genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are
                 being developed to provide computational predictions on the
                 functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the
                 search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different
                 classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are
                 involved in human diseases, including substitutions,
                 insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations.
                 Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a
                 negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools
                 primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single
                 amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid
                 conservation at the position of interest among related
                 sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to
                 insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile
                 alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging
                 effects of variations not limited to single amino acid
                 substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and
                 multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score
                 measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence
                 to a protein sequence homolog before and after the
                 introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence.
                 Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in
                 separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from
                 common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein
                 variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n =
                 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt
                 non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under
                 the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the
                 human and non-human protein variation datasets is ∼0.85. We
                 also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with
                 the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we
                 have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation
                 Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to
                 predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations
                 including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and
                 in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is

  abstract    = "IMPORTANCE: Understanding molecular mechanisms of response and
                 resistance to anticancer therapies requires prospective
                 patient follow-up and clinical and functional validation of
                 both common and low-frequency mutations. We describe a
                 whole-exome sequencing (WES) precision medicine trial focused
                 on patients with advanced cancer. OBJECTIVE: To understand how
                 WES data affect therapeutic decision making in patients with
                 advanced cancer and to identify novel biomarkers of response.
                 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients with metastatic and
                 treatment-resistant cancer were prospectively enrolled at a
                 single academic center for paired metastatic tumor and normal
                 tissue WES during a 19-month period (February 2013 through
                 September 2014). A comprehensive computational pipeline was
                 used to detect point mutations, indels, and copy number
                 alterations. Mutations were categorized as category 1, 2, or 3
                 on the basis of actionability; clinical reports were generated
                 and discussed in precision tumor board. Patients were observed
                 for 7 to 25 months for correlation of molecular information
                 with clinical response. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
                 Feasibility, use of WES for decision making, and
                 identification of novel biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 154
                 tumor-normal pairs from 97 patients with a range of metastatic
                 cancers were sequenced, with a mean coverage of 95X and 16
                 somatic alterations detected per patient. In total, 16
                 mutations were category 1 (targeted therapy available), 98
                 were category 2 (biologically relevant), and 1474 were
                 category 3 (unknown significance). Overall, WES provided
                 informative results in 91 cases (94\%), including alterations
                 for which there is an approved drug, there are therapies in
                 clinical or preclinical development, or they are considered
                 drivers and potentially actionable (category 1-2); however,
                 treatment was guided in only 5 patients (5\%) on the basis of
                 these recommendations because of access to clinical trials
                 and/or off-label use of drugs. Among unexpected findings, a
                 patient with prostate cancer with exceptional response to
                 treatment was identified who harbored a somatic hemizygous
                 deletion of the DNA repair gene FANCA and putative partial
                 loss of function of the second allele through germline
                 missense variant. Follow-up experiments established that loss
                 of FANCA function was associated with platinum
                 hypersensitivity both in vitro and in patient-derived
                 xenografts, thus providing biologic rationale and functional
                 evidence for his extreme clinical response. CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: The majority of advanced, treatment-resistant
                 tumors across tumor types harbor biologically informative
                 alterations. The establishment of a clinical trial for WES of
                 metastatic tumors with prospective follow-up of patients can
                 help identify candidate predictive biomarkers of response.",

  abstract    = "PURPOSE: Implementing cancer precision medicine in the clinic
                 requires assessing the therapeutic relevance of genomic
                 alterations. A main challenge is the systematic interpretation
                 of whole-exome sequencing (WES) data for clinical care.
                 METHODS: One hundred sixty-five adults with metastatic
                 colorectal and lung adenocarcinomas were prospectively
                 enrolled in the CanSeq study. WES was performed on DNA
                 extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsy
                 samples and matched blood samples. Somatic and germ-line
                 alterations were ranked according to therapeutic or clinical
                 relevance. Results were interpreted using an integrated
                 somatic and germ-line framework and returned in accordance
                 with patient preferences. RESULTS: At the time of this
                 analysis, WES had been performed and results returned to the
                 clinical team for 165 participants. Of 768 curated somatic
                 alterations, only 31\% were associated with clinical evidence
                 and 69\% with preclinical or inferential evidence. Of 806
                 curated germ-line variants, 5\% were clinically relevant and
                 56\% were classified as variants of unknown significance. The
                 variant review and decision-making processes were effective
                 when the process was changed from that of a Molecular Tumor
                 Board to a protocol-based approach. CONCLUSION: The
                 development of novel interpretive and decision-support tools
                 that draw from scientific and clinical evidence will be
                 crucial for the success of cancer precision medicine in WES

                 (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is the world's largest and most
                 comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic
                 mutations in human cancer. Our latest release (v70; Aug 2014)
                 describes 2 002 811 coding point mutations in over one million
                 tumor samples and across most human genes. To emphasize depth
                 of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is
                 curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very
                 precise definitions of disease types and patient details.
                 Combination of almost 20,000 published studies gives
                 substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate
                 in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of
                 mutations and biomarkers across cancer patient populations.
                 Conversely, our curation of cancer genomes (over 12,000)
                 emphasizes knowledge breadth, driving discovery of
                 unrecognized cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets.
                 Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique,
                 giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human
                 oncology. In addition, COSMIC also details more than six
                 million noncoding mutations, 10,534 gene fusions, 61,299
                 genome rearrangements, 695,504 abnormal copy number segments
                 and 60,119,787 abnormal expression variants. All these types
                 of somatic mutation are annotated to both the human genome and
                 each affected coding gene, then correlated across disease and

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Clinical genomic testing is dependent on the
                 robust identification and reporting of variant-level
                 information in relation to disease. With the shift to
                 high-throughput sequencing, a major challenge for clinical
                 diagnostics is the cross-identification of variants called on
                 their genomic position to resources that rely on transcript-
                 or protein-based descriptions. METHODS: We evaluated the
                 accuracy of three tools (SnpEff, Variant Effect Predictor, and
                 Variation Reporter) that generate transcript and protein-based
                 variant nomenclature from genomic coordinates according to
                 guidelines by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Our
                 evaluation was based on transcript-controlled comparisons to a
                 manually curated set of 126 test variants of various types
                 drawn from data sources, each with HGVS-compliant transcript
                 and protein descriptors. We further evaluated the concordance
                 between annotations generated by Snpeff and Variant Effect
                 Predictor and those in major germline and cancer databases:
                 ClinVar and COSMIC, respectively. RESULTS: We find that there
                 is substantial discordance between the annotation tools and
                 databases in the description of insertions and/or deletions.
                 Using our ground truth set of variants, constructed
                 specifically to identify challenging events, accuracy was
                 between 80 and 90\% for coding and 50 and 70\% for protein
                 changes for 114 to 126 variants. Exact concordance for SNV
                 syntax was over 99.5\% between ClinVar and Variant Effect
                 Predictor and SnpEff, but less than 90\% for non-SNV variants.
                 For COSMIC, exact concordance for coding and protein SNVs was
                 between 65 and 88\% and less than 15\% for insertions. Across
                 the tools and datasets, there was a wide range of different
                 but equivalent expressions describing protein variants.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal significant inconsistency in
                 variant representation across tools and databases. While some
                 of these syntax differences may be clear to a clinician, they
                 can confound variant matching, an important step in variant
                 classification. These results highlight the urgent need for
                 the adoption and adherence to uniform standards in variant
                 annotation, with consistent reporting on the genomic
                 reference, to enable accurate and efficient data-driven

  abstract    = "Following initial characterization of the reference human
                 genome, initiatives have evolved worldwide to identify genomic
                 aberrations in cancer with the aim of deriving diagnostic,
                 prognostic and predictive information. However, the functional
                 and clinical relevance of many somatic variants in cancer are
                 presently unknown and there is no consensus definition of
                 'actionability' for genomic aberrancies. Therefore, while
                 robust detection of a variety of genetic aberrations in
                 clinical specimens remains a technical hurdle, the greater
                 challenge lies in the interpretation of these alterations.
                 Critical evaluation of genomic variation in cancer requires
                 the integration of available clinical and preclinical evidence
                 related to their frequencies, functions and roles as
                 therapeutic targets. Many publicly accessible data resources
                 have compiled such evidence to facilitate the understanding of
                 genomic results and ultimately translating results to clinical
                 action. Information for these data resources is derived from
                 various sources including large population genomic datasets,
                 curation of published literature, and data sharing by the
                 scientific community. Currently, there is no widely accepted
                 guidance to definitively assess and integrate the diagnostic,
                 prognostic and predictive information of somatic variants
                 using these knowledge databases. This review will describe

                 interpretation of actionable genomic aberrations by
                 clinicians, and highlight relevant issues in the clinical
